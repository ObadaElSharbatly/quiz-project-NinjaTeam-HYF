## Development

To run this project locally you will need to open `index.html` in your browser using a local server. LiveServer, `http-server`, `study-lenses`, or any other local static server will work.

## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [x] A user can see one question at a time, stepping through the quiz
- [x] A user can select an answer for each question
- [x] A user can know which questions they got correct and incorrect (either immediately or at the end of the quiz)
- [x] A user can see the correct answer for questions (either immediately or at the end of the quiz)
- [x] A user can see their score at the end of the quiz

## Nice-to-Haves

- [ ] A user has access to resources for further study on each question
- [ ] A user can "cheat" to see the correct answer, this forfeits the question
