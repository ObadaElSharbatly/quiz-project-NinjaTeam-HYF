# Getting Started
![screenshot of the app](public\img\app-screenshot.JPG)
This repository functions as the basis of the quiz project in the [Browsers module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers). Before the first group meeting, have a look through this code and try to understand how it works and how it is organized. We will explain the idea behind the structure below as well as the Backlog (which will identify what is needed to be implemented).

We have already implemented a very basic UI that can go through the questions to show you how this kind of code is split and how you can use the structure to your advantage. Have a look through it before your first group meeting as it can take a little while to get your head around it!

## Development

To run this project locally you will need to open `index.html` in your browser using a local server. LiveServer, `http-server`, `study-lenses`, or any other local static server will work.

## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [x] A user can see one question at a time, stepping through the quiz
- [x] A user can select an answer for each question
- [x] A user can know which questions they got correct and incorrect (either immediately or at the end of the quiz)
- [x] A user can see the correct answer for questions (either immediately or at the end of the quiz)
- [x] A user can see their score at the end of the quiz

## Nice-to-Haves

> if time, add more features!

- [x] A user can see their score update in real-time as they select answers
- [ ] A user can modify a question in the quiz
- [ ] A user has access to resources for further study on each question
- [ ] A user can "cheat" to see the correct answer, this forfeits the question
- [ ] A user can remove questions from the quiz
- [ ] A user can add questions to the quiz
- [x] Anything else you can think of... go nuts!
